# whisper-automation
What I wanted was a function to extract subtitles from a large number of video files in the language of that country and translate the extracted subtitles.

## usage
You can use it by modifying the script a little.
* auto_whisper.py : Whisper moves around the folder. Extract subtitles using GPU.
* auto_translte.py : gpt-4o-mini smoothes the subtitles generated by whisper.
  * use your openai api key.
  * When it's done, a _done file is created, and since this is used to determine that the translation is complete, even if the program terminates in the middle, it can be skipped whenever it's restarted.
  * If it fails, it takes 5 more retries with increasingly better models before it finally achieves its goal.

I'm not sure if I'll continue updating, but good luck!
